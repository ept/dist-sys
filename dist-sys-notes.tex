% Setup for supervision problem sheets. \supervision takes two arguments: the question and the
% solution notes. The default definition in setup.tex simply ignores the second argument. However,
% here we write out both question and solution notes to a separate file called exercises.tex.
% That file is then imported from solutions.tex in order to produce the file of solution notes for
% supervisors. This helps ensure that supervisor notes and lecture notes are consistent.
